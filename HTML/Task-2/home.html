		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet's overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned.</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough water on a regular basis.</p>
